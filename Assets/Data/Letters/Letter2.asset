  text: 'Hello Vanessa,

    How are you doing little one ? You know, I told you
    about some adjustments where you live in. I just received confirmation that I
    can do it. All the necessaries are ready, so I can come do my things whenever
    you want.

    Have a nice day, little one !

    Jack.
